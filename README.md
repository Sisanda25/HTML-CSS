# HTML-CSS
# INTRODUCTION TO HTML
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
It serves as a channel for different types of content like words, images, videos, audio, forms, and interactive experiences.
It allows us to structure our content and bridge the gap between human and computer languages.
# HTML FUNCTIONS
HTML has a straightforward structure without any programming logic, loops, or functions. It is known as a declarative language. 
The code simply declares instructions like "This is a paragraph!" or "Make this a link!" or "Put a form field here!". 
It is all about using the right vocabulary and making declarations.
# HTML BASICS
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration. For example: Doctype html.
# HTML ELEMENTS
It is everything from the start tag to the end tag.
Elements can be nested, meaning that elements can contain other elements.
# HTML HEADINGS
Are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpages.
There are elements that are used for marking up headlines that come in a six different types that is head 1 to 6.
When viewed in a browser, each headlines has a distinct visual effect.
# HTML FORMATTING
HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning.
There are several formatting elements, which are (bold,italic,subscript,superscript,important,emphazised,smallest, marked)texts.
# HTML WORKING WITH GRAPHICS AND IMAGES
When we want to add an image to a webpage, we use the image element, which is simply written as IMG. 
First, we have the source attribute (SRC), which tells the browser which image file to load. 
We also have the alt attribute (ALT), which provides a text description of the image. 
Lastly, we have the width and height attributes, which determine the size of the image. So, every image should have all four of these attributes.
The image's URL is pasted into the source, as can be seen in the example, and then the image starts loading.
There are four main file formats commonly used on the web these days, each with its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to compressing images.And those four main file formats are: GIF, SVG, JPG, PNG.
CSS offers a solution for displaying images in different sizes to accommodate both large screens and small screens.
HTML allows us to deliver different image files to screens of different sizes.
# HTML WORKING WITH MEDIA
#WORKING WITH AUDIO- The audio element is different from the image element because it has both an opening and a closing tag. This makes it more modern and gives it more power and flexibility. Just like the image element, we use a source attribute to provide the URL of the audio file. 
here are different audio file formats to choose from. For example MP3.
MP3s are widely supported in modern browsers, while OGG had some advantages but did not gain much popularity. 
There may be a new format on the horizon, similar to the AV1 video file format, but not widely available yet. For this reason, there is no second audio format recommended at the moment. Nevertheless, it is important to understand the syntax for supporting multiple formats, as it was crucial in the past and will likely be useful again in the near future. 
Furthermore, it is possible to provide fallback text within the audio element, which will only be displayed if the browser does not understand the audio element at all. This demonstrates the resilience of HTML, where a single set of code can cater to a wide variety of browsers and provide a suitable user experience. The audio element is an excellent tool for embedding audio files and a player on a webpage.
#WORKING WITH VIDEO-The web has completely changed how we connect and share things, including movies, TV shows, and even teaching. Thanks to the power of the web, we can now easily put videos on web pages using the HTML video element. 
Just like the audio element, the video element has an opening and closing tag. To display a video, use the source attribute to specify the video file. And if the controls attribute is added, the browser will automatically create a video player. Sounds simple right? But there are a couple of issues that need to be addressed.
Just like with image formats like PNG, JPEG, GIF, or SVG, there are different codecs that can be used to encode video files. Video files contain a lot of data, and if not compressed, they become too large to be efficiently transmitted over the internet. Internet videos, therefore, use a mechanism to compress all the data into a smaller package. 
# HTML CONTENT IDENTIFICATION
The internet is worldwide, and people speak various languages. In HTML, there are tools to indicate the language of your content. By setting things up correctly, search engines will understand which language websites are in. Spell checkers will provide the appropriate dictionaries, and when a browser reads the content aloud,it will prounance the word correctly. It is important for computers to know the language of the content it is processing.
The lang attribute is used to specify the language of a webpage. If the whole page is in one language, it is quite simple. Set the language on the main element that wraps everything else, which is usually the HTML element. It may only be required to set it once, like in a template file that applies to the entire site but do not forget to do it.
# HTML INTEGRATION
HTML and all the elements, attributes, roles, and tools used to mark up content on websites or web apps have been covered. HTML plays a major role in explaining what these things are, but it is not just limited to that. HTML files are a vital part of the web. 
In the early days of the web, everything needed to display a webpage was contained in a single HTML file, along with images, but things have gotten more complex now. Text is often stored in databases, and multiple static files are combined in real-time, customized for each user. Visual styling is in CSS files, JavaScript is in separate JavaScript files, and there are additional files for images, video, audio, and ads.
Once the browser gets the file, it starts reading it immediately and follows the instructions one by one. The file has a bunch of other files listed in it, so the browser promptly requests those as well. Once it has all the required files, it begins executing the instructions inside them. And before you realize it, a web page is magically generated in a blink of an eye.
nce the HTML file is built, there are a few crucial parts that every web page needs(Firstly, the file should begin with a doctype statement, which indicates the era of this HTML file. In the past, there were different doctype declarations for older HTML versions. By including this one, we are saying, "Hey, this is a modern web page, so follow modern best practices and treat it accordingly"). (Next, we enclose everything else on the page within an HTML element, which means an element named HTML. It tells us that all the content within it is HTML. Place the opening HTML tag at the top and the closing HTML tag at the bottom).
# CSS INTRODUCTION
CSS, short for cascading style sheets, is the language that controls the pretty stuff on websites.
CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.
CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
HTML and CSS work hand in hand to create the visual aspects of a webpage. By learning the basics of CSS, you will be able to effectively collaborate and communicate with your developer team. It is recommended to have foundational HTML knowledge before diving into this course.
CSS has two parts: The Selector and the declaration block.
The selector specifies a pattern in the HTML, and if the pattern matches, the styles within the declaration block are applied to the corresponding HTML elements. It is possible to have multiple styles applied to the same pattern, and that is where the cascading part of CSS comes into play. However, we will keep things simple in this course and will not dive deep into cascading.
In CSS, each style declaration consists of two parts: The property and the Value.
THe first aspect of CSS is the selector because it is essential to be able to select specific elements in our HTML. Without that ability, understanding the properties and values will not be very useful. So, at the beginning of this course, we'll start by creating some unattractive web pages. But do not worry, by the end of the course, your pages will greatly improve as we incorporate key styles. Let's dive into the code and get started.
# Writting your first comment and Element selector
To get started with CSS, we will begin by writing simple CSS code for your document. In the Exercise Files, locate the link to the starting Sublime Text for this section titled "01-01-start: Writing Your First Element Selector”. When you open it, find a set of headings, subheadings, and paragraphs that we can work with. 
# Grouping Selectors
There are times when you want to apply the same style to different types of selectors. For example, if we want all the paragraphs on this page to be green.
# Formatting color in CSS
After selecting a color palette, the next step is to incorporate it into your code. It may sound straightforward since this has already been covered in this course. Up to this point, we have been using what are referred to as named colors. These are colors that have specific names assigned to them. However, while there are millions of colors available online, only a limited number of them have names in CSS. 
he provided color chart displays some examples of these named colors that you can use in your code. However, it is important to note that your color palette may not include any named colors, and there are only around 130 of them available. So what do you do if the color you want to use doesn't have a name.
Hex values are typically six-digits long and consist of numbers zero to nine and letters A to F. The first two digits represent red, the next two represent green, and the final two represent blue. These digits correspond to numbers ranging from zero to 255.
While editing other people's CSS, you may come across different syntax worth mentioning. For instance, the hex value "7778899" can be shortened to "789" if each two-digit pair is the same. This three-digit format is relatively common but only applicable when the numbers are identical. 
Another syntax you might encounter is the RGB format, where colors are written out using Base 10 numbers to specify the red, green, and blue channels. This format can also be represented as an eight-digit hex number or RGBA. In both cases, the last number (e.g., "CC" in the hex value or "0.8" in the RGB value) corresponds to Alpha, which relates to the opacity and transparency of the color. It determines how well we can see through the color. Other color formats like HSL or HSLA may also be used occasionally, particularly within platforms like Squarespace.
# Understanding types in css
Unattractive and poorly designed web pages bother most people and they agree that there is something undeniably wrong with the way these pages look. The two main issues are the fonts and the spacing.
In general, people who are not designers usually categorize fonts into two types: Serif and sans serif.
Serif fonts have small lines at the ends of the letters called serifs. In the past, serif fonts were used for printed materials with long text blocks. When letters were manually set on a printing press, they were never perfectly aligned. The serifs helped connect the letters, making the text easier to read. 
Sans serif fonts do not have serifs and have a more modern appearance. With computer typesetting, sans serif fonts are mainly used on the web for extended text because they look clean and are easy to read.
Web fonts are a bit more complicated than print fonts because they depend on where the fonts come from. People access web pages using various devices like phones, tablets, and desktop computers. Some individuals have many fonts installed, while others only have the default fonts on their devices. When a font is not specifically listed, your web page will call for a font from the user's device. This limits your font choices when working with CSS. To ensure compatibility, it is common to specify multiple fonts at once, known as a font stack.
For instance, a common font stack is Arial, Helvetica, sans serif. Arial is commonly available on PCs, Helvetica on Macs, and sans serif is a fallback that requests the device's default sans serif font if Arial or Helvetica are not available. Other fonts that are usually safe to call from user devices include Verdana, Times, Times New Roman, Georgia, Trebuchet MS, and Comic Sans. Although, it might be better to resist using Comic Sans font altogether.
After learning about fonts, let's dive into coding. In the previous challenge solution from chapter two, things looked okay but not great. So now we will make some modifications to improve the appearance using different fonts. First, add a font-family property to the body element. This property allows us to change the fonts on the page. Use a font stack, starting with Arial, then Helvetica, and finally Sans-serif. The web browser will evaluate these fonts in order. If Aerial is installed, it will be displayed. Otherwise, it will try Helvetica. If neither is available, the default Sans-serif font on the computer will be used.
Up until now, the size of our text has been determined by the web browser's default style sheet. There is nothing inherently bad about these sizes, but sometimes you may feel the need to modify them or apply them selectively to specific sections of text.
According to web developers, the preferred font size unit is usually "rem." In simpler terms, 1 rem is equivalent to 16 pixels. So, if the font size is specified as 1.5 rem, you can multiply it by 16 to get the size in pixels, which would be approximately 24 pixels. Conversely, if the font size is set as 0.8 rem, it is roughly the same as 13 pixels. Luckily, you do not have to perform these calculations manually because there are numerous online calculators available for this purpose. Let's check out one of those calculators.
This is the Point to REM Converter tool found on codebeautify.org. You can access it through the provided link in your exercise files. When working with web design, some people find it easier to think in pixels rather than rem, especially if they receive sizes in points from their designer, which is common in print design. This calculator helps you convert between different size units used on the web.
For example, let's say you want to work with a font size of 18 pixels. You can enter that value into the font size calculator, and it will convert it to 1.125 rem, which is the recommended format. The calculator also provides conversions for em and percent, which are alternative size units. Em is less commonly used nowadays, while percent is great for layouts. However, rem is the most popular unit for font sizes.
Similarly, if a graphic designer tells you to use 18 points, the converter will give you the equivalent in rem, which in this case would be 1.5 rem. It's important to note that rem can have decimal values, so keep that in mind. Now that you know how to convert sizes, you can apply this knowledge in your code to ensure consistency between what you envision and what appears on your web page.
# Understanding the Box Model in CSS
The web page we have created looks decent with the basic CSS we applied. However, one major issue is the lack of spacing. We can see that there is not enough room between the text and the color bars. 
In web development, every HTML element is like a box with different properties. These properties are always present, even if their value is zero and not visible. Let's break down how these properties work. First, we have the content, which is the text inside the box. Then, there is the border, which is like a line surrounding the content. We can choose to display all four sides of the border or just a few. And there are various styles available for the border. 
Next, we have the padding, which is the space between the border and the content. It can also have its own background color. When we add padding, we are essentially pushing the edge of the box away from the content. 
We can assign properties to individual sides or apply them to all four sides at once. There are shorthand values available for border, padding, and margin, which provide a more concise way to set these properties. Only a few examples have been provided here, but there is more to explore on this topic.
# After learning about border padding and margin, it is time to put that knowledge into practice on our web page.
Currently, an image has been added to the page, and there are some issues we need to address. The background leaves are not in the right place anymore, and there are spacing problems. For instance, "H Plus Sport" does not reach the top of the web page, and the bars do not extend across the page. To fix these, start with the body element, which has a default margin from the browser's style sheet. Remove that margin by setting it to zero. As for the leaves, they are currently positioned 97% down the page, but we want them at the bottom. One solution is to add a footer element and move the background image from the body to the footer. Also give the footer some height and add a border on the top to separate it from the rest of the page.
Now, let's focus on the headings. By default, headings have margins that create space above and below the text. You can remove the margin from the H1 to push it to the top of the page. However, this makes the text look cramped against the edges. To create some space, use the padding property. Adding a few rems of padding will give us a nicely spaced red bar with the text.
In the HTML, there's an image in the middle of the page. To center it, put it inside a paragraph with a class of "circle" and set the text-align property of the paragraph to center. This will effectively center the image within the paragraph.
By applying these CSS modifications, our page will start looking much better. With a few selectors, key properties, values, and some attention to spacing and fonts, we can achieve a well-designed page with minimal CSS.
# Advanced CSS And prporties and concepts
# Styling links in css: Links play a significant role on the internet. Typically, links are blue and underlined, and once you click on them, they turn purple. In this exercise, we are examining the Sublime Text.
Currently, a guest tab in Chrome is being used, which doesn't show the visit history for certain courses. So even though web pages were visited, it appears that all the links are unvisited. Let's focus on formatting links in HTML and CSS. To change the color of the text on a web page, you can specify the color code, like dc267f, which turns the heading and bullets into hot pink. However, the links remain their default blue color (or maybe blue and purple for you) because browsers have their own style sheet that prioritizes the default link styles over the styles applied to the body element. So, how can we style the links in a way that makes sense? Let's dive deeper into that.
he best approach is to target links using the "a" anchor tag. We can specify "a" and set the color to 648fff, a nicer blue color than before. This style will apply to all links, including visited links, which will also turn blue. The reason behind this is that the browser's style sheet had blue and purple for links, but now we've added a new style that makes everything blue. 
# Inheritance in css
The concept of inheritance and specificity in CSS is quite complex. In this beginner-level course, these concepts were briefly introduced, however, we have come across inheritance a few times. So, let’s explain it in a more tangible way to make you aware of how it works in your CSS. 
The web page being worked on is the earliest version, and a few links were added for the sake of demonstration. Now let's go through the process of styling it again and talk about what is happening as these styles are applied. Since you are already familiar with the code, it will make more sense to you now.
First, start with the "body" element and set the font family to Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif. As expected, the entire web page changes to the Arial font. This is seen many times before, but here is something interesting. If a solid red border of four pixels are added to the body, we get a single border around the web page. Now, if we look at the HTML, we will not see the body element in SublimeText, but it is there just before the H1 and before the closing body tag, at the end of the document. What is remarkable is that even though only the font family for the body was specified, all the HTML elements inside it inherit the same Arial font. 
If you use a selector "*", which selects everything on the page, and apply the border to it instead of the body, we end up with a crazy-looking web page. The "*" selector, as you might know from other areas of computing, selects absolutely everything. Here every HTML element is selected and given a border. This is what it would look like if borders were inherited, and as you can see, it is a total mess.
Who wants this to occur in their document? Well, if someone did, they could utilize a style like this. However, for the majority of us, we prefer it to happen only once. Therefore, we would like to apply the border to the body without it being inherited. This idea of inheritance will probably affect developers more than the average person, but it is still important to be aware of it.
# Debugging css with borders and background colors
Sometimes you come across a problem when styling elements with CSS. You might wonder which element you should style or why your styles are not working as expected. When facing such challenges, debugging can be very helpful. 
One trick is to add a background color or a border to the element you want to style. This can reveal hidden information. For instance, let's look at an example with an unordered list (UL) in HTML. If we want to know the exact position of the UL on the page, we can add a border to it using a CSS style like "border: 2px solid red." This border will show us the full width of the UL, which extends across the body element. 
Now, let's compare the UL to the link (A) within the list item (LI). By setting the background color of the link to FFB000, we can see that the links are only as wide as their content. This distinction between block and inline elements is important. Block elements, like the UL and LI, take up the full width of their container (in this case, the body), while inline elements, like the links (A), are only as wide as their content. This observation becomes clear in our CSS example. 
Suppose you want a hover effect that spans the entire width of the element but only for the link. You might be puzzled about what is happening on the side. In this case, you can change the A (link) to an LI (list item). Now, the LI also spans the full width because it's a block-level element. We can then apply a hover effect to the LI using the "LI:hover" selector. Notice how the hover effect covers the entire document width, whereas the link part does not? The cursor behavior also changes, indicating that clicking is possible only when hovering over the A element. This could be a problem you are trying to diagnose—why can you not click at the edges of the document? The answer lies in the fact that you are working with a link that is only as wide as its text. 
There are ways to solve this issue. For more advanced users, a quick fix is to add the CSS style "display: block" to the A selector, which stretches the link across the page. Additionally, you can define a hover state for the link using "A:hover" to change the background color and text color. Now, when you hover over the edges, the hand cursor indicates that the link is clickable, and the hover state spans the entire list.
We gradually solved this problem by experimenting with borders and background colors. It is a useful approach when debugging CSS code. 
Do not worry if it looks unattractive at first. Focus on getting it to work properly, and then you can remove all the unattractive elements and transform it into a beautiful design once the functionality is correct.

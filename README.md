# HTML-CSS
# INTRODUCTION TO HTML
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
It serves as a channel for different types of content like words, images, videos, audio, forms, and interactive experiences.
It allows us to structure our content and bridge the gap between human and computer languages.
# HTML FUNCTIONS
HTML has a straightforward structure without any programming logic, loops, or functions. It is known as a declarative language. 
The code simply declares instructions like "This is a paragraph!" or "Make this a link!" or "Put a form field here!". 
It is all about using the right vocabulary and making declarations.
# HTML BASICS
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration. For example: Doctype html.
# HTML ELEMENTS
It is everything from the start tag to the end tag.
Elements can be nested, meaning that elements can contain other elements.
# HTML HEADINGS
Are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpages.
There are elements that are used for marking up headlines that come in a six different types that is head 1 to 6.
When viewed in a browser, each headlines has a distinct visual effect.
# HTML FORMATTING
HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning.
There are several formatting elements, which are (bold,italic,subscript,superscript,important,emphazised,smallest, marked)texts.
# HTML WORKING WITH GRAPHICS AND IMAGES
When we want to add an image to a webpage, we use the image element, which is simply written as IMG. 
First, we have the source attribute (SRC), which tells the browser which image file to load. 
We also have the alt attribute (ALT), which provides a text description of the image. 
Lastly, we have the width and height attributes, which determine the size of the image. So, every image should have all four of these attributes.
The image's URL is pasted into the source, as can be seen in the example, and then the image starts loading.
There are four main file formats commonly used on the web these days, each with its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to compressing images.And those four main file formats are: GIF, SVG, JPG, PNG.
CSS offers a solution for displaying images in different sizes to accommodate both large screens and small screens.
HTML allows us to deliver different image files to screens of different sizes.
